# Project: Brain Games

Brain Games is my first educational project on the Hexlet platform, consisting of a set of mini-games. You can learn more about each of them by watching the asciinemas below.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:AutumnQR/fullstack-javascript-project-44.git`
2. Install dependencies: `make install`.
3. Use one of the following commands to start the game:
- `brain-even` or `make brain-even`
- `brain-calc` or `make brain-calc`
- `brain-gcd` or `make brain-gcd`
- `brain-progression` or `make brain-progression`
- `brain-prime` or `make brain-prime`

Descriptions for each individual game are provided below in the "Asciinemas" section.
